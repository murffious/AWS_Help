/* 

  React usees state but this could be for Angular or anything using this pattern. Even Vue.

  I have noticed while jumping in and seeing errors on UI issues in front end apps that all these quesitons need to be addressed for each part of the UI 
  What happens to state when these things happen OR what type of data[state] persistence do you expect to have - testing checklist sheet for these items
   newer developers or some veterans who don't ansser all the UIUX quesitons of what to do in each case need to do this more
  1. Refresh
  2. Hit back on the browser
  3. Hit back on bread crumbs or step of a process and forward to (back and forth)
  4. log in and or log out processes
  variation /random combination of all of these-- 
  TODO - use facebook as example of how this sohould be and compare to amazon or twitter 

  Things like spinner, UI dummy loader components - I have wanted to write this down and now realize I may have another docs for this ...
